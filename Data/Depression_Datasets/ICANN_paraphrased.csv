"I’m a 21 year old and my birthday is in two week’s (st.Patrick’s day), my entire life has been rough. From the moment I was born I had heart issue’s and growing up I had a growth deficiency, to then my ribs growing in words and crushing my lung’s along with asthma. That’s just a small portion but it sums it up. From losing my dad at 15 when I finally was at an age to do thing’s he liked which I developed a love for because I got to hangout with him, to then never being able to do them again and having to retire from hockey and sports because my lungs are so small due to my chest issues. Everyone left, I had nobody when I lost my dad, I spent years silent, didn’t talk to anyone, same racial expression everyday. I dragged myself out of the hole, then life continues and people keep coming and going and destroying me on the way out with friends betraying me and relationships being cheated on. I’ve never been good enough for anyone. My mother doesn’t speak to me anymore, she’ll go through my siblings to contact me. She also moved across the usa. Finally I’ve hit a point where I just don’t want to keep praying for better day‘s. It’s been 6 years of in and out of hospitals for mental issues and thing’s just never get better. I then lost my best friends dad from cancer whose family took me in when I was on the brink of ending it all and they helped me get better and it worked until my previous relationship. I mean I was happy again. Like I felt normal. I wasn’t crying every morning and every night. I was excited for the day. But it’s been about 9 months since that and I’ve cut the world off and I haven’t spoke to anyone in week’s bc nobody ever tried to contact me and it was always me reaching out so I stop tried. I have no confidence left and I have no chill anymore, I’m just the guy that’s there with his headphones in always. I’m tired. I can’t seem to do anything right. I just want to be at peace, I don’t want to be here but I can’t do that to my siblings. Even tho we don’t get along well I don’t want them to enter a depressed state like I’ve gone through for years. I’m just running out of energy and idk how much longer I can do it until I just say fuck it and be done and end it, end my pain. Nobody seem’s to care about my pain so idk why I should care about anyone else’s anymore. I’ve always been the person who will help anyone even if I barely know them. But nobody does it for me..","I am 21 years old and my birthday is Patrick's day, my life has been rough from the moment I was born.",2421,102
"I use to drink often, I stopped. I'm very intoxicated so I might be all over. Shit happens right. I've been depressed for so fucking long it hurts to think about. At 13, 16, 19 everyone says it'll get better. I'm 23 and nothing's gotten any better. I had a 3 year relationship and she threw me to the curb. I had a 2 year relationship following (after a break from the 1st, we only dated a year but were close/fuck buddies for a year leading to it) and we broke up tonight, fun fact we still live together until july. My depression doesn't stem from relationships, there's a plethora of things contributing to it. I think I'm out of my depth on this one. We were fuck buddies because I didn't want another relationship. I didn't want to give someone a chance to hurt me again. She was moving for school and I couldn't bare the thought of losing her so I asked her to date and we planned and did move in together. I've punched myself in the face because it's less damaging then cutting myself. I think at this point if I self harm it'll be the end. I promised myself that long ago though I didn't follow through the last time I started cutting myself. This time I think I would, one pump of adrenaline is all it would take then I wouldn't be hurt anymore. I left all my friends for her, I moved an hour away for her. I dont see a point in living, I dont see a point in eating or sleeping. I dont know what I'm expecting fro. This honestly, I have noone but my sister and I hate being a burden on her (though tonight she may have kept me here). I know how I'd do it, it would be a 10 minute trip to get what I need. I dont want to but I have nothing and noone. No friends, out.of my family only my nana and sister talk to me. I've texted my dad yesterday and today about a car issue and that's the most we've talked in 2 days than I can remember. Usually it's around 1 a month, sometimes more sometimes less. I'm a burden on everyone. I think the world would be a better place. All I can think about is putting a knife against my throat and givin' er. Relationships didn't cause this, certainly attributed. No friends, no family, noone to hurt if I die. I dont know what I was hoping to accomplish with this post but I think its pushed me farther towards doing it. I hope you have a good day, thanks for taking a few minutes to read my messy/suicidal thoughts. Tldr: have a good day.",I stopped drinking because I've been depressed for a long time.,2397,63
"I have been diagnosed with major depression and anxiety years ago. Hi, I'm a 41 year old male with a good job, make good money, why should I be hurting? Depression, anxiety and suicide runs in my family. I have been committed to a 72 hour hold twice for being suicidal and planning my suicide. I do self harm. I think about suicide weekly, sometimes daily. I don't want medication but I self medicate with alcohol, work obsession or high risk sports. I'm embarrassed because I can't fit in with life, I'm broken with no fix. I suffer in silence as I don't want to bother my family, friends and girlfriend. I have planned my suicide many times, even tonight. Yes, I have written many suicide notes as well. If I tell someone, they lock me up without shoelaces. This is not what I need, this causes me to hide it even more. I'm broken with no fix. I already go through cycles of being numb, angry, and sad. I don't want to feel numb from medication (I've been there before, what is the purpose.). I don't trust anyone to talk about this with, they respond with ways that make me hide my what I truly feel. I want this pain to stop, the pain I've been feeling for years. Why am I broken? Besides not waking up, I don't know what else is the answer. I understand why my family member committed suicide, I get it, it isn't selfish, it is to stop the pain that many can't understand. I don't know what to do. Do I end it, hide in silence and keep everyone happy, or say something and be even more miserable and in turn become more numb? Who really cares? I know alcohol doesn't help, but it helps me sleep, or if I don't drink here I am wide awake trying to make my brain quiet. I do high risk sports, secretly hoping that I will die. I spent last night at the emergency room alone, I didn't contact my family, friends and erased a message for my girlfriend (I wasn't sure if it was a heart attack and didn't want to die alone but didn't want to bother anyone). My girlfriend saw some erased messages, so I told my girlfriend that it was some chest pain I wanted to make sure wasn't anything, I never told my family or friends and never will. I don't know what to do, I need this to stop. This is my cycle, I'm numb or angry at everyone and push everyone way. If I wake up tomorrow, I will think whoever wrote this is an idiot and stupid, numb and ignorant to the pain I feel. Cycle repeats. Help.",I am a 41 year old male with a good job and good money who has been diagnosed with major depression and anxiety.,2397,112
"I have been having more and more chest pains while I have a heart condition. I’ve been to the ER for it before but at this point as much as I want to live I don’t think I’ll ever be happy living. The more I’ve been thinking more about the world and people the more I realize how little control we have. We are attracted to people because that’s who our environment and biology tells us to be attracted to, we do actions based on the same two things. As you can probably tell I’m a hard determinist. I don’t believe anyone is special, I don’t believe in love. Most days I have slivers of happiness but those slivers are over come with feelings of extreme loneliness. When I say slivers I mean a second or two followed by a dive into the abyss of sadness. Anyone I think I actually connect to leaves. I don’t blame them either. I’m talking to this women who tells me that kissing for her is not cheating. I tried to understand why I would feel bad if someone I was with kisses someone else, is it my insecurity, is it my fear they will leave (under the umbrella of insecurity, I realize) idk. She tells me each connection you have is special but I’m thinking if they’re all special, then, none of them are. And if this connection was so special why would the person sever it. I mean there might be a multitude of reasons but at the end of the day it becomes as if that “special” person doesn’t exist anymore. But, if y’all do manage to keep talking how does one person not feel the pain. I guess you both have to be in healthy relationships on your own (that could end at any moment) and have to not depend on a relationship. Isn’t our end goal to produce viable offspring though. So wouldn’t we be working, looking good, exercising all to make us an appealing mate. Is there any authenticity if you have no control over the people you bond with and they don’t either. Is their anyone special out there to face the cruel oblivion with or are we, more so am I, destined to feel alone for the rest of my life. Ugh I hate this, I feel like shit and lonely but logic my way out of it but still feel like fucking garbage :( if we meet someone special shouldn’t that be enough to make us happy, since some people never feel that. So we should be happy for being lucky, I mean I guess. Jesus, why can’t I just be happy There is so much more I want to say but this is already too long for no one to read",I have been going to the ER for chest pains before but I don't think I will ever be happy.,2394,90
"I hate always being reminded our lives are going to school, getting an education, hopefully get a good paying job and pay taxes. I know there are other stuff, Marriage or whatever. But as another year passes, I feel the years flying. I remember being in elementary telling my self in recess, “wow, I’m never getting to high school.” Here I am, I was a positive child and adults had hope for me. It’s sad to see depression hold me down. If I need to be happy I need to change something. I hate taking meds and being on a schedule. People are gonna treat me different if they find out. My dumb arrogant self also lashed out at my girl best friend. I think she hates me. I said sorry like a million times, I wrote paragraphs to get her to forgive me. She recently came up front and told me she was feeling suicidal recently, and me getting mad at her just made it worst. I’m trying to fix it as best as I can. She said if she can get a hug but she still won’t talk to me in class, hallways, or over text. Her reason is she doesn’t like getting personal. And she’s told me in the past she’s had family problems, so I know she’s stressed. I don’t know if I’m annoying her but I’m keeping positive vibes. Just today one of my “friends” with ADHD said his friend was gonna give him a gun and shoot two teachers. I trust one of my gym teachers the most in the school, more than my family. I mean the guys gone through it. I had him for class a year ago, and in that same year he was divorced. He knows depression and stress. Anyways I told him and he thanked me a bunch. I think he’s speculated I have depression, he’s a health teacher and I always talk to him so I know he knows somethings off. He sent me to the VP and told him the story. They both basically hailed me for keeping the school safe. And I’m grateful. I like being reminded people care for me, I just don’t see it. And neither do you probably. Think of an old teacher or friend you always talked too, I’m betting they’re missing you right now. Alright I know I wrote a lot but it just kind of blurted out, I knew I had some stuff going on, but now I’ve wrote it out I see the bigger picture of my self. I’m sorry if I’m not making sense, it doesn’t to me either. Someone loves you, I swear about that. Don’t take your life, don’t take another’s, maintain those you love, because they love you back. I love you all, Crispy","I don't like being reminded that our lives are going to school, getting an education, hopefully get a good paying job and pay taxes.",2386,132
"My first post ever on reddit. Im feeling so low right now, been crying all night, and I just want to get better, but nothing seems to work. During Christmas vacation, I realised my partner had been cheating on me, the night I founded out, he went to that girl house and had intercourse with her. He still came back to my place after and told me everything the next day. I completely lost it, It was the first time someone cheated on me. I felt betrayed, and couldnt wrap my head around it. My reaction was to drink as much alcool, smoke cigarette until I could forget what happen.. unfortunately that wasnt enough I was still feeling so much pain. I than decides to take a half empty bottle of xanax with a bottle of antidepressant. Just to wash the pain away, just like that I was doing my first suicide attempt. 20 minutes after I realised what I had done and called emergency, an ambulance came over and I spent 24 hours at psychiatry aisle. I started seeing a psychiatrist after that, and was diagnosed for borderline personality. For me it makes sense, but it seems close friend and family think its too much, that Im not borderline.. thing is Im really good at hiding my true self. Ive been boulimic for years without anyone ever knew I was. Ive been having intense rage and impulsive reaction when Im in love. Anyway.. lets come back to my story, I ended up staying with my partner, a decision that has been torturing me ever since. There is not a day that passes without me thinking he would so ut again. I will think about what happened imagining it until I start feeling sick, and than everything turns black again. I havent been easy with him after that, but how could I ? My psychiatrist just prescribed me a new drug to mix with my antidepressants and I started them yesterday, I hate all the side effect if taking a new drugs and I just feel like I want to give up. ive been having a lot of fights with my partner in the last days cause I dont find him supportive. I feel so alone right now, I tried to communicate with him but its just too much, I feel like a burden for him and its been breaking me even more. There is so much in life that I wanted, like I always wanted to have a kid, but I feel so unlovable... I feel like my mental health is taking too much place, I need help. I need a reason to keep going","I just want to get better, but nothing seems to work, I have been crying all night, and my partner cheated on me the night I founded out.",2334,137
"i think i saw myself in the tub five times this whole day so far and its only 4pm. i care for the people around me very deeply and just the thought of them being devastated when i leave makes me even more depressed. i deal with all of this all by myself as everybody does. i feel bad because everyone eventually leaves me after realizing how difficult my situation is and how draining it can be to deal with it. i guess you can say i’m a big ass burden. i’m not the best worker. i’m incredibly lazy. not because i choose to have fun, but because i don’t feel good enough. my motivation to do anything is at a 0. another factor of why is i never know what i want to do. my upbringing wasn’t great and i was always constantly thrown off course from the things i really wanted to do to cater to people who didn’t care to see me happy. now i’m kinda doing my own shit without being asked, but it took me almost a year to learn how to think for myself. all thanks to my current partner though. i’m starting to lose hope though. although i do have people i care for, i’m afraid of telling them how i feel beyond just “i’m depressed.” i know it makes the people around me really sad and sometimes suicidal themselves. so i stay quiet of the actual extent of how bad it can be. and because of my job, its hard to make friends. i can’t even tell people about what i do. do you know how lonely it gets? having to bottle everything up but too afraid to tell people how its just eating me up slowly. i was doing well for a second with my job and then last week, i spent the whole time all burnt out, crying nonstop just by myself. i but because of my condition and how it’s affecting me, i’m losing the one person who was able to get me to be productive and ignore my feelings. people are gonna comment and say “don’t ignore your feelings,” but i’m tired of having it impede my progress. and i know if they leave, i’ll go back to how i was; not doing anything and just laying all curled up in a ball just waiting for death to come naturally. now i feel like i should just end it to avoid all of this. i’m too much of a burden. i just want them to be happy. edit: my mom called me while i was writing this and now, i really wanna leave. just hearing her voice makes me so sad. so sad that she gave birth to someone like this.",I have seen myself in the tub five times so far today and I am depressed because of the thought of the people around me being devastated when I leave.,2316,150
"I just don't know how to be normal anymore. The littlest things can set me off. I'm always hurting peoples feelings with jokes I make, then I always say ""Don't be so sensitive"" when I know for sure it was MY fault they got offended. It's hard for me to take responsibility. I also feel very alone, and I don't mean the sense of friendships. I'm talking about romantic relationships. I've had about 4 or 5 concussions, and I say that because I know I've definitely had some that weren't diagnosed as I used to box. It's just really hard for me to say what I want to say. I fumble my words a lot, and I noticed that after my most recent concussion about a month ago. For example, one thing I said that I regret was calling a girl a ""dyke"" because she said something rude to me. What I said was so uncalled for, especially since I knew she was bisexual. I feel like trash because I don't say things like this (homophobic) all the time per-say, but that is just an example of how offensive and unregulated the stuff that comes out of my mouth on the daily. I constantly have to be high on marijuana most of the time to keep my mood up and I don't want to be like that. The weed just makes things worse for me when I'm not high because I get even more irritable then I was before I smoked and I go through bad anxiety and psychosis episodes. I also feel like a failure. I am in my senior year of high school and I feel hopeless. My grades are all F's and I don't know what to do anymore. I plan on going to trade school after this year but I probably won't follow through on that because I never follow through on anything I want to do, as my anxiety prevents me from doing lots of stuff. I think about suicide but the thought scares me and it's just and endless cycle of just that and it sends me down a dark hole in my thoughts. I feel hopeless like nothing can help me anymore. Also, I don't want to sound pathetic but its what I am. I told the girl I like that I liked her. She said doesn't reciprocate those feelings but it hurt when she said she liked me 2 years prior. It especially hurt because I liked her back then as well. Once again my anxiety prevents me from being happy and thats all I want, is too be happy again. It's been at least 4 years of feeling like this. Sorry for the rambling at the end.",I don't know how to be normal anymore. The littlest things can set me off.,2316,74
"I realized recently that I might have bipolar disorder based on a couple of friends I know who have it and also the symptom checklists that I have looked at. I have been diagnosed with general anxiety as depression but lately it’s felt more than that, particularly in the swings between extreme optimism and sociability, and pessimism’s day depression. Anyways I was looking online and found an online counseling website. One of the boxes you have to fill out is info that the counselor will look over in order to have a better understanding upfront. As I was filling it out I poured my heart into it and explained my feelings better than I ever had to anyone before, even myself. I was feeling like there was hope in figuring out what the fucks going on in my head. Then I hit the “next page” button and it brought me to the payment section. Never did the website mention that it was a paid thing up until this page. I understand that it’s a business and the counselors have to get paid somehow in order to not do a completely shit job, but the fact that they didn’t mention that until you’ve already broken yourself down and opened up really pissed me off. It felt like they were saying, “okay what’s going on, what’s wrong? Oh no that’s unfortunate, now before I give you any help for all of the super personal stuff you just opened up to me about, I’m gonna need your credit card info. Oh you can’t afford it, well fuck off then.” It’s 3:23 am where I live and I feel completely stuck. I am a college student working two jobs just trying to make ends meet while also juggling the exhausting unpredictable bullshit in my head everyday, and the fact that I have to pay for help with something I didn’t ask for and wouldn’t wish on my worst enemy kind of astounds me at the moment. I don’t know where I’d be if I had visited the site without the semi level head that I have right now and had been hit with that price tag for my well being.

"Ever since I came to the States for college, I've just been in a depressive state of mind. School killed my passion for what I wanted to do with a shit ton of work and almost no free time to myself. I want to change schools/take a gap year, but I am unable to do that due to financial reasons. I don't have friends in school. I have classmates, but they feel more like coworkers who are just concerned about themselves and their own career, more than friends. My family doesn't feel like a family; it's a nightmare where everyone hates each other. I used to be a very optimistic guy with very little pessimism. But now, I feel like my pessimistic side has taken over me. I *think* that there's an inner voice that tells me that I should go ahead and kill myself because it's an easy solution to every single problem I have. I also noticed that I'm not being my original self anymore. I lose patience way faster than I used to, I get upset more easily, and so much more. I feel like I've lost my own self. I don't know who I am anymore. Everything seems pointless and nothing motivates me to work hard and live life anymore. BUT I know I shouldn't act on suicide. I understand that it's wrong and selfish. And my reasons to suicide are not reasonable AT ALL. I keep telling myself that I'm just in a rough patch of life and it's just a small hill that I'd have to climb over. School, on the other hand, is just a lot of work. The stress piled up from the amount of work, family issues, financial concerns, **and** my depressive shit thoughts does not help at all. Further, my procrastination absolutely fucked me over this semester. I'm going to fail my classes and probably have to retake them. My parents are going to be crazy mad at me, yet I don't care for some reason. My concerns aren't at school, but at life itself. I don't know what to do. I don't know what I should do. I can't tell if I became a lazy person and now I'm trying to justify my laziness or if this is just my body's response to a lot of stress accumulated over the years. I hate the state of mind that I am in. I hate that I think too much. I hate myself for allowing myself to become this person.","I've been depressed since I came to the US for college, and I want to change schools.",2177,85
"I’ve been *somewhat* suicidal myself. More so in the “Im in so much pain I want to stop existing” than having a plan to end it all kind of way. I love someone dearly who has attempted suicide more than once and been hospitalized after their attempts. They also struggle with addiction. I’ve also lost someone I love to suicide. They’ve called me, more than once, often drunk or high, sometimes not, telling me goodbye, this was the end, and this was their plan (I don’t know if specific phrases are allowed, so to generalize, the gist is I have all I need to kill myself readily accessible/I am in the location where I’m going to kill my self and when we hang up I’m going to do it) Sometimes, I’m close enough that I can physically go to be with them. Sometimes I’m not. Every time, I feel like their life is in my hands. That’s not a responsibility I feel like I can handle. If something were to happen to them, I’d feel entirely responsible. I feel like I’ve read so much that suggestions to seek professional help aren’t helpful and the last thing to do is call the police or emergency services... but I am so scared. I love my friend and I want them to know it. I want them to know how truly I support them and don’t blame them for what they’re feeling or think they’re doing anything wrong. Because I truly don’t. But I can’t handle feeling like their life is in my hands. I can’t handle feeling like if I say the wrong thing or don’t say the RIGHT thing and they die, it’s on me because I’m the one they chose to come to for help. I feel like I can’t be the help in these situations, but I don’t want to turn them away when they clearly need someone. It would be different if it wasn’t an active plan. I’m comfortable with I want to die sentiments. I’m comfortable with listening to someone talk about their deep pain and hatred towards themselves or ambivalence towards life. But the goodbye. The plan. The “I’m dead after we hang up” .... I don’t know what I’m supposed to do. I feel like I HAVE to take that seriously, because if I don’t, and they die... I have no words for what would come next. Anyway. Any advice about any of this is appreciated.","I have been suicidal myself, but I don't have a plan to end it all kind of way.",2174,79
"I understand losing a job. Losing your mom. Getting cheated on and finding out about it in the most cliche possible way. Losing hope in everything. I was so self destructive before and after. Just wanted to not feel. Way before any of this shit started to happen. It’s difficult accepting and understanding what’s happened in the past has effectively shaped you in a negative and positive way. But most of us stop there. I’m stopped there. The negative way, it’s so easy to get caught in that loop. We can be right about some things but it doesn’t change anything. I say I can’t believe I’ve gotten this bad for good. I won’t bore anyone with details of my childhood as we all have a few nights worth of stories. Just know you always have a decision and it’s yours.

What can I change to make me think that I don’t care about what people think even though that was on my mind 99% of the time and stressing me out.

"Hello I am certain that I have been suffering from anxiety and depression for a number of years. As a result I completely withdrawn myself from society but the end of last year it was time for me to get a job, try and put myself back out there and hopefully make myself live bit more comfortably, and maybe give myself a chance of recovering life in my late 20s. I also believe I have dypraxia as I have difficulty talking to people in certain situations but I have complete fluency in others. However, having got this job I'm experiencing a number of things of which I have experienced in every role since I have been working and that is people are quick to jump to conclusions, and this isn't me being paranoid. This is an accumulation of experiences that are similar for me and I know what will happen in a few months I'll be the most hated person at that job and everyday I go, they will most likely give me hell. Can I say I have a mental health condition to my employer if I haven't been diagnosed? I don't really want them to personally attack me every time I enter a new workplace because I would like a chance of living too. Why are people so quick to assess one another then give them hell because one person front talk properly? I really needed a job which is why I never said anything about a mental health condition as I believe this would have almost certainly affected my chances. What should I do? Because if I don't do anything then I know what will happen during this adventure of employment, I will have to leave because of comments and accusations that aren't true. Something doesn't seem right there. Also, I know there is something wrong because hardly want to talk to anyone nowadays. I have no friends out of choice as an example. I dreamt of working very insular jobs growing up. Well may as well kill myself because no one can help they can give me placebos but they won't give me the one thing which will cure depression and other mental illnesses in an instant but they can't give me the job I wanted to do with my life so tell me what is the point?

"I am in a very dark place right now. I'm 32. I've been unemployed since last October after getting laid off (not due to performance, my whole team and 15% of my company got let go) and do not have a firm idea of what to do with my life. I have started to interview again over the past few weeks but they are mostly for the same type of work (which is pretty niche, not a ton of jobs available) and I just don't know if this is what I want to be doing for the rest of my life. In the meantime, I have been getting dicked around by recruiters and just feel like I'm getting left out to pasture even though I feel like I have a good background and interview well. Simultaneously, I am finishing up a part-time MBA program which I feel like has been a colossal waste of time, money, and energy. I honestly feel like I had better luck getting responses to job applications BEFORE starting my program. I have been slogging through my final semester, struggling to find the motivation to do my work. I finish in about 2 months, at which time I may or may not be employed again. I just don't know. It's extremely stressful. I will need to begin paying my college loans within 6 months of graduating and don't know how I am ever going to save for a down payment. I immensely regret going to business school. Add to this the fact that, for whatever reason, I seem to be getting ignored by just about every therapist I've reached out to for counseling. Maybe I need to start leaving messages that I'm thinking about ending it. I feel like I am losing my mind, and the only thing that keeps me feeling sane is my girlfriend, who without I'm not sure what I'd do. Unfortunately, she doesn't know about my compulsive masturbation/porn addiction which seems to be consuming my life at the moment. I'm a \*\*\*\*ing mess and I don't know what to do. It's hard for me to think about actually killing myself, but I find myself thinking about it often. It gives me some sort of dark solace knowing that I could end it, donate everything I have (which isn't much) to some charity, and be remembered as more than a living nobody, which I feel like I am today.",I'm not sure what to do with my life now that I've been out of work for over a year.,2152,84
"I haven't been sleeping much lately, I wake up with heavy drowsiness, despite not being able to fall asleep. I don't want to continue like this, I don't want to live if this is what life is. My daily thoughts are riddled with shame, regret, disappointment, anger, and worry. There is so much I wish I had done differently, or not at all. I don't talk to anyone about it because no one would quite understand. It is much easier said than done to not compare oneself to others, forgive, or move on from the past. I haven't lived a day of my life at the age of 25 because of my circumstances and poor decision making. I feel helpless and powerless. The world is hostile, overly competitive, and parasitic. The deluded turn to their illusions of grandeur via religion, but no loving god would allow this atrocity of a world. I don't feel I have a place that I belong I wish I had made friends sooner, I don't have anyone now and I feel that I am just a burden. I wish I had gotten a job instead of letting myself be pressured into post secondary education, I have no money or direction now and I feel that I am a failure. I wish I had stood up for myself in bad relationships, I don't have any self respect now and I feel that I am a weak loser. I wish I had matured sooner, I am very far behind in life and I feel that I cannot catch up. I wish I had any confidence in myself, I am convinced that it is too late to make anything worthwhile because the foundations of my life are rotten and building on rotten foundation is recipe for disaster. I wish I had a better family, a better community, a better world to live in, and I wish I was a better person. No matter what anyone says, I don't believe much can change. I'm not like others, I wish I was. I can't use social media at all because it floors me to see others doing things I wanted to do, and seeing the results of the better choices they made. I wish life were easier, people were kinder, mistakes could be undone, and I wish I didn't feel so down all the time. I've long since learned that it doesn't matter what I think or want; I have no power, influence, or real drive left to change","I don't want to continue like this, I don't want to live if this is what life is.",2149,81
"Last year i got done with my senior highschool year and despite working soo hard for since june till the next june, studying hours daily i ended up falling short of the percentage i needed to enter the major i wanted to which is computer science and let myself and my family down. I had to major in finances since it was my only choice and i am hating it. Moreover i am hating the fact that i am living with myself as a failure, i never achieve anygoals that i want and i never get anywhere. I have OCD which i am taking medication and therapy for and it has been kicking in so hard lately with all the negativity making me go crazy. I am always depressed and my family is disappointed from me. I just feel like a burden now on every body around me i always have breakdowns and my family always blasts me for it. All my relatives are engineers and other good majors and jobs and i am stuck in this. i am sorry if my writing isnt organized but i am so disoriented right now. I feel like if i just die i would relief every body around me from my burden and relief them from the shame of having me. I cant stand living with my self knowing that i an a complete and utter failure. I dont deserve anything. I will never get anywhere in life i just want it all to end. i just want to die i cant live with myself anymore. And it is a relief knowing that when i die no one will care as i dont want to hurt anyone. I have no friends, my family wish they didnt have me. My relatives didnt even care to call or visit me when i was hospitalized after a cycling accident. I just wish to die and be forgotten instead of living in misery and burdening my family. I dont want to kill my self because i am a bit religious and suicide is prohibited in my religion but i wish i could. I just want to die i cant live anymore. I hate my self. I hate seeing my self in the mirror every morning.I hatr waking up and knowing i am still alive. i cry my self to sleep every might wishing i never wakeup again but i still do. I dont know where to escape or where to go with all my shame and deprisson. I wish i would die this instant. I need help but nothing can help me.","I had to let myself and my family down because I fell short of the percentage I needed to enter the major I wanted to enter, computer science.",2144,142
"I hate my life so much I question why I’m even here sometimes , like what’s the mandatory policy to life? which way should you go? well when ur born everyone tells you the ideal path in life. Go to school, Get a job, Settle down, Start a Family and so on ... well I’m a fucking piece of shit and already started fucking up my whole life and I wanna take it back I mean for god sake I don’t even have someone I can express this crisis too I gotta go on the Internet and spill my heart out to feel content with how I’m feeling and I’m feeling fucking overwhelmed. like no one cares right? no dude, no one fucking cares and that’s when I go back to my first statement why am I here anyways? to do drugs, to have an abusive “boyfriend” that can give less of a fuck when u wake up in the middle of the night crying because you’re overthinking everything you scared yourself wide awake? Because no one should even care in the first place, but what’s a life that’s so empty no one can even comfort you? but again that’s life no ones suppose to actually give a fuck about you all you got is yourself and when you realize that it gets even more lonely. I’m to the point where I’m scared of life and don’t wanna live it but scared of what happens when it ends anyways. What if I die without really living out my full potential because I already lived it out ? was my purpose so little I didn’t even get to realize it before I died? I don’t know I just know life isn’t easy but no one said it was, it just looked that way when things were easier, when people still cared and the world seemed so curious there were a million possibilities life could take you but now you just worry away because all the people the cared are gone and now all the curiosity went away because you’ve seen all the ugly in the world and nothing looks beautiful anymore. maybe I’m just depressed and can’t ever really be happy ? I haven’t felt genuine happiness without drugs in such a long time maybe I’m defective. I don’t even think anyone cares enough to even read this much but if you did and you’re reading this thank you for hearing me out this actually helped a bit.",I wonder what the mandatory policy to life is when I hate my life so much.,2139,74
"I've struggled with major depressive disorder for years now, I was officially diagnosed in 2016 but I know I had it for about 5 years before that at least. I've had a suicide attempt (right before officially being diagnosed) and since have had ups and downs... the downs happen about every other year. Tonight I'm sitting at work, wanting to run away, cry, and hide. I've been doing fairly good lately but I just received life changing news a few nights ago, and I am not ready for this change. I told my SO exactly how I feel and what I want (well maybe I should say don't want), which was relieving and helped me feel better for a few minutes but now I'm back to stressed out and wanting to cry. I'm worried he secretly hates that I don't want the change. Will he break up with me even though we are engaged and haven't had any issues? I hope not.. he always tells me he wants me to be honest with him and not keep things from him, so I'm trying to be open/honest but I know he doesn't enjoy hearing my honest opinions and feelings at times. How can you bring a child into the world though when both parents would be in debt, one is jobless, we aren't even married yet, I struggle with my mental health/anxiety regarding everything about having a kid even all the crap before they are born, and one parent is a registered sex offender still on probation??? I can't do this. I was hopeful for the first couple of days... but then i started considering more about our situation and how we are NOT ready. I haven't tols many people at all, but I told him today if I can't abort it then I want to seriously give it up for adoption. I just can't. Call me irresponsible for not being more careful. I try to have the mentality of ""everything happens for a reason"" but I can feel myself falling apart mentally. Work helps distract me to a degree but there is a lot of downtime tonight and I keep ruminating and feeling down. I'm also pretty sure I'm too far along to get an abortion and it isn't like we can afford it anyway.

"I’m 30yr male, living alone, unemployed, broke, alone, and the only thing that get me going is my dream to become a filmmaker, but that dream now starting to fall apart. Filmmaking has been literally the thing that shape who i am today. I’ve been doing videography and editing stuff for almost 10 years, beside doing my passion project, i also earn a living by edit and produce video for small businesses. Overtime I learned alot about the entertainment industry, but i never part of them. Instead i just do my freelance work, but i do have a dream, to make a feature film. Knowing my own lacking, i study and research as much as i could about independent film and unfortunately in my country, indie scene is basically non existent. I decided to fund my own film, because nobody wants to finance a stranger like me. Earlier this year, I thought this year will be the year I finally made it. I sold my car and use my saving to fund a film project which i hope can be the one that gets people attention. As i slowly developing the project, i met several industry folks, with the intention of gaining knowledge and get some support, but instead all i got is them dismissed and laughed at my project because I’m a fool to even dream about making a film with my budget, and more importantly, I’m nobody. I was treated nonchalantly. Hate to say this, but i do agree on some of the points they gave. Now I’m aware, even if i did make the film, the chances for it to actually help me further my career is slim. I love doing this, and i would love to make a living with this, but moneys are tight, the thought of giving up the only thing i passionate the most in my life, kills me. Today, I’m just laying hopelessly typing this crap on my phone. I lost all the passion, and motivation to keep going. I’m tired of seeing people, i spent my days at home alone. I’m embarrassed with my friends and family, especially my mom, who has been nothing but supportive. I’m contemplating if i should let go of this dream and looking for a new job at 30yr.","I am 30 years old, living alone, unemployed, broke, alone, and my dream to become a filmmaker is starting to fall apart.",2041,120
"Is it just me or does the world seem to be fucked ever since 2012. I wish the world ended in 2012 so I wouldn't have to deal with all the bullshit that I have been through.

I have seen my only friend go through drug addiction and drug related psychosis. I have seen how life can shit all over you. My depression started at an early age because of bullying and lack of friends. Except the one in my life currently, you can't destroy our relationship. I feel like my depression really kicked in when I was around 15 or 16. My friend moved away to another city and I was left all alone. At the time bullying got worse and I made a few acquaintances but no real close friends. When I was 17 I dropped out of school and moved out of my family home. I started to have panic attacks in the shower and that was when I turned to drugs to numb the pain. Xanax was my go to for sedation as I could fight the effects somehow I loved that. Iv been a daily cannabis smoker for most of the time since I was 16 except the times I ran out and couldn't get anymore. I have done lots of psychedelics (u could call me a psychonaut) any sort of alternate reality really. Cannabis helps motivate me to stuff. I'm currently 19, still a virgin and struggling with financial situations. I only just earn enough money every week to cover my bills so I never really buy anything for myself except weed. I can never seem to get ahead of my depression. It's like it just keeps dragging me down.

"Over the last few years, I've gone through various cycles of depression, anxiety &amp; panic attacks. I've fallen into the trap of everything's fine again i'm alright, only to be hit by a oncoming train of depression 6 months later. I spend a lot of time in my room alone &amp; I rarely leave the house much and when I do leave I feel massively anxious &amp; I feel much worse when dealing with people. I get hit sporadicly with depression &amp; insomnia, which makes everything so much worse. Insomnia has a truely wonderful talent of nuking everything. I feel like I have no future and certainly no future or a life where i'm happy or even content. I've spoken to friends and loved ones about jobs and I always get the wishy-washy response of ""you'll be fine"" or ""everything will work out fine"". I want to have purpose in life but I just feel so incredibly hollow &amp; low all the time &amp; all my interests and hobbies just fade away. I'm absolutely terrified of applying for jobs (i've had a few interviews that completely nuked my mental health for more than a year) in fear that it's going to destroy my mental health again (had very bad experiences in my last job) and it doesn't help when friends/family tell me I need to apply or jobs or that i'm lazy. I really don't know what it is i'm suppose to do? or what it is that people think I should be doing? My biggest concern is that I just feel like if this is something I have to cope with for the rest of my life, I just don't think I'm going to be able to cope and I really worry where that will lead and what bearing it'll have on the important decisions in life. I'm really struggling to help myself and get help. Even writing this post has been hard (this is my fifth attempt) &amp; composing my thoughts has been really difficult. Has anyone had similar problems? or been in a similar situation and overcome it? I really don't want this but I feel like i'm stuck with it unable to do anything about it.

"I'm 24 and still have terrible acne. I used to not hate the way i looked up until high school, but then I got hit with the acne. Huge cystic acne that left scars all over my face and is super painful. I used to look at myself in high school the mirror and say "" I hate myself and want to die"" as a mantra. I was holding onto the hope that it was just a teenage phase, and that I would get on with my life after. Now its been years and years and I still get new zits and cysts every day. It's painful, and they pop and bleed everywhere. I've tried all of the acne treatments except accutaine which my doctor recommended against for reasons in my medical history. To offset the acne I grew my hair long and made it my main feature to distract from the disgusting acne. It became such a large part of my personality that all my friends at the time called me goldilocks. Then recently ago I started balding really quickly. My hairline is going way back, and I'm starting to lose hair on my crown. Looking at old pictures of my dad it's all gonna be gone in a few years. I can't stand to look at myself in the mirror. My face is red and pocked and covered in acne and the one and only thing that I liked about my appearance is slowly falling away. I'm some sort of freakish middle age man/ greasy teen hybrid. I used to have moderate luck is the relationship department back when I had my hair, but noone will even look at me now. My hair was the only thing I was ever complimented on. Now I'm treated like some monster that noone wants in their pictures or their life. I've been trying to not off myself for a while now.

"I’ve been combatting them for years and they are so strong they prevent me from being a functional member of society. I’ve (sort of) attempted suicide twice within the last 8 years. And I wish I just went more balls deep with it when I did. I’ve been inpatient in mental hospitals, I’ve done IOP programs, PHP programs, DBT, CBT, etc. for over 13 years and even after following all of these things I’ve learned, the suicidal thoughts always win. I’ve been on prescription after prescription and some may help lessen the frequency but they never actually go away. I can’t tell my therapist (or any professional) these things because I’ll instantly be admitted. I’m already $1000+ in debt with medical bills from hospitalizations and therapy, and I can’t afford another useless admission. All hospitalizations are is just a cash grab and a reason to house suicidal people and bankrupt them while profiting off of their health insurance. I don’t even have the energy or willpower to go to work anymore. But my boss will fire me if I miss another day of work. But I can’t go to the doctors to get a doctor’s note or provide any excuse as to why I didn’t come in or else I’ll be hospitalized.

I know, I know… Everyone fucks up, but why does it feel like the world is ending when the people that mean the most to me fall short of my unrealistic expectations? Why do I feel ridiculously deceived? Surely I am their whole entire life, surely their world revolves around me.

"I mean yes never feeling happiness, always feeling tired, and all that other shit that comes with depression would've contributed to this, but I think I'm just using depression as an excuse to hide the fact that I'm a terrible person. I've had depression since at least the age of 10. I'm 17 now and until about a year or two ago my depression was never a huge problem. I was passing school, I had friends and I had hobbies. But one day after my suicide attempt I got a random boost in motivation, and I felt happiness for the first time in years. Feeling happiness only made me realize how miserable I am all the time, which led to me figuring out that I have depression. Ever since I became aware of this, I started doing things like, failing school, ghosting friends, and dropping out of hobbies. Whenever I smile or laugh, I hide it and try my best to make myself sad. I fetishized my sadness, sadness was my happy place, and being happy was painful for me. I feel like I'm just putting on a play for myself to hide the fact that I'm just a selfish ass, who does nothing but play videogames all day. Now here's a good confession, I don't have a suicide attempt, yeah when the the day came I was to lazy to get out of bed and walk to the railway so I just didn't. Yet everyone I've told my story to has heard me talk about my suicide attempt, I told myself this so much that I actually forgot I never even tried for a while, but it's all a lie, just an excuse to make me look more broken then I already am. Some days I think of actually going there, and reenacting that moment to see if I'll actually do it or not, but I'm to lazy to get out of bed so as if I'd do that. I fear that my therapist will find out. That if I get cured from my depression that I'm still going to be just as shitty as always and that it was just me all along. If that's true then that means there's no curing me, and that I'm just going to be like this forever.","I think I'm just using depression as an excuse to hide the fact that I'm a terrible person, because never feeling happiness, always feeling tired, and all that other shit that comes with depression would've contributed to this.",1944,227

"It is very frustrating to have the feeling of ""today shall be the day"" and have every single little detail planned out and yet, it is suddenly so hard to execute it.

I was brutally raped for 2 months. By my best friends boyfriend. My best friend died of cancer. A month later her boyfriend messaged me saying he just needed a friend. I went over that night to his place. I regret ever doing that. He drugged and raped me. The next morning he threatened me. Told me if I didn’t keep giving him what he wanted he would kill me and himself. I was terrified. For 2 months every day I let him abuse and rape me. Out of fear.

I sleep in my free periods at school and I sleep when I get home at 2:30pm. I wake up around 8pm, eat and go back to bed. My dreams are starting to be better then my own life. While I dream I feel happy, I don’t feel weighed down. I don’t feel like I’m alone. I don’t feel numb. I went to the school counselor for help last week. All she told me was to tell my mom how I was feeling and go see a doctor. That is the hardest thing I can possibly do. She will think it’s her fault, similar to how she took my sisters anxiety problem, and I can’t burden that on her. I don’t know what to do. Edit: grammar","I feel exhausted, my eyes are tired, and I can't find joy in guitar and video games.",887,84
"People keep telling me that if I kill myself, then the depression will win the fight. Here’s the catch, they think I fucking care if it wins. I don’t give a shit anymore. I’m not even using a throwaway account because I don’t care about keeping it a secret. Why would I care if the depression wins? All I want is peace, and if it takes the depression winning over me to achieve that, then why should I care at all? I don’t. Idk why I’m even posting here. I’m not sure if I’m subconsciously looking for help, or just attention. Who knows. I don’t want to hurt my family, but at the same time I’m hurting them when I even tell them about my thoughts. I can’t fucking win anything anymore. I don’t know what to do. I’m so goddamn pathetic it’s unbelievable.

"Everyone is constantly interrupting me and talking over me. Whenever I try talking about my problems no one seems to care and just counteracts it by saying how they have it harder. I mean, I guess they do but I wish I could just talk to someone at school without them saying how they have like so much more work and they got two hours of sleep last night. That’s why I hate being nice and supportive sometimes. I listen to other people, I help other people and I feel like it almost never gets returned. I’m there for other people but it feels like no one is there for me. And it’s not only at school. At home, I’m the youngest and it feels like they just ignore what I say, and don’t listen to anything I have to say. They are so proud of my sister, and I am too, but they don’t care as much about my accomplishments and awards. Maybe it’s because they aren’t as impressive as hers?",I wish they wouldn't say how they have it harder when I try to talk about my problems.,884,86
"Every single night it's been so hard just to exist and breathe and I have desperately wanted to end my life. Tonight I let my dog out and I saw a package on my doorstep and it was from a couple of friends that I haven't spoken to in a couple months who were worried about me. A bunch of doctor who stuff and star trek socks, literally everything that I would love. I cried when I opened it. I become so convinced that I'm worthless and I'm horrible to be around and I stop talking with people who actually care about me. I called them instantly and they weren't even mad that I haven't talked to them in so long. I wish I could tell them how much it means to me but I'm afraid to let people know that I've been suicidal because I don't want them to be worried.

"I don’t wanna specify my age, but I’m young. Because of this my mom thinks that I’m faking and won’t accept it. Even when I tell my school counselor that I just don’t want to be alive anymore and they send police to my house to check up on me, my mom won’t believe me. Even when I tell her to at least get a doctor to diagnose me, she won’t, As previously mentioned, the place came to my house and they suggested that I might want to get a therapist. My mom said ok yeah sure whatever. A week later and I remind her. She says yeah I’m on it, another week goes by and my mom tells me that she just doesn’t want to pay for something that I’m probably faking for attention. All this is just making it worse.

"For the longest time, I couldn't see myself living past 25. This mostly came about towards the last year of University and got worse around the end of 2017, when I wasn't landing work. In 2018, I met someone and suddenly I felt alive again. I felt calm and collected. Although I was stuck in the same loop of applying for work, it didn't feel as tiresome. In 2019, I got accepted into medicine and moved overseas. My partner starts tearing us apart 3 weeks into my move... I drop out of med school because the stresses from the break up became way too much to handle. Especially since I was overseas. Now I am back to applying for jobs in my old degree and getting nowhere. I am heavily depressed. I can't see myself past 25 again. I have this strong feeling I will die this year.

Debt is high. Work sucks. I feel alone in the world. I have thought about suicide almost every day of my life for thirty years. But I never can find the courage to actually do it. And here I am circling the drain again. I just feel like all of the stress and all of the unhappiness and depression will be gone if I just .... cease. I spent this afternoon researching methods. I even did a performative thing with a belt around my neck. Turns tour it slips out of the doorjamb. I know how to tie a noose and a couple kinds of slipknot. But there is no good place for me here to tie off the other end of the rope. I don't know what I want. Do I want someone to stop me? Do I want someone to give me the psychological push I need to kill myself? I don't know. I am so unhappy. I don't want to deal with any of this anymore.

I'm kinda confident in my intelligence so I think I have a good chance of getting in, but not like this. Thinking feels tiring for me, so I tend to spend most of my life in a dissociative fugue state, if that makes sense? I feel anxiety when I force myself to think analytically. I also feel like I can't ask for help from anyone around me. I'm mostly a stoic person who's infamous for showing no outward emotion, so people mostly get amused when I'm upset, which enrages me.

I just want to know because although I haven’t been depressed my whole life, I have been in a very deep depressive episode the past year and a half and my memory is appalling. I’ve genuinely totally forgotten most of my life, especially how I felt during previous periods of time. (This memory loss is related to dissociation and prolonged trauma as well as low serotonin) My friend said that she’s come out of her depression and that she feels different. She feels ambitious and the dog has gone. Things feel less difficult. It’s given me so much hope and I want to hear your success stories. Because I know that it’s common to feel like it’ll never end.

Even I try to pray to a God to take me back to 1994. Even my life is going no where. I have a mental illness called schizophrenia where the brain cognitive is dysfunctional. Hallucinations and hearing voices that arent their. Which makes me think solipsism. But hell im no God when I believe a God. Since I didnt create clouds trees or even DINOSAURS. I admit mental illness has no path of success. Even I want to give up to pray for a new one cause im getting old. If I could live forever I would cause dying isnt going to get better.

The problem is that this isn't going to work soon, due to the warmer seasons approaching. I have to quickly decide if I want to die.
